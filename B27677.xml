            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

I cannot doubt but your Lordship will protect it, for nothing ever flew to you for succor unsuccessfully, I am sure I have reason to acknowledge it. As for the unluckey censures some have past upon me for this
<pb facs="tcp:199273:3"/> Play, I hope your Lordship will believe I hardly deserve 'em. For to my best remembrance, when first I was accused of the thing by some people of the World, who had perhaps as little reason to think I could be guilty of it, as to believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves deserved it, I made it my business to clear my self to your Lordship, whose good opinion is dearer to me then any thing which my worst Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can wrong me of else; I hope I convinc't your Lordship of my Innocence in the matter, which I would not have endeavoured, had it not been Just. For I thank my Stars I know my self better then (for all the Threats some have been pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon me) to tell a lie to save my Throat. Forgive me my Lord this trouble, continue me in your Lordships favour and good opinion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Prayers and well-wishes of</p>

            <l>HOW hard a task hath that poor Drudg of Stage,</l>
            <l>That strives to please in this Fantastick Age?</l>
            <l>It is a thing so difficult to hit,</l>
            <l>That he's a Fool that thinks to do't by Wit;</l>
            <l>Therefore our Author bad me plainly say,</l>
            <l>You must not look for any in his Play.</l>
            <l>I'th' next place, Ladies, there's no Bawdy in't,</l>
            <l>No not so much as one well-meaning hint;</l>
            <l>Nay more, 'twas written every word he says</l>
            <l>On strictest Vigils and on Fasting Days,</l>
            <l>When he his Flesh to Pennance did enjoin,</l>
            <l>Nay took such care to work it chast and fine,</l>
            <l>He Dissiplin'd himself at every Line.</l>
            <l>Then Gentlemen no Libel he intends,</l>
            <l>Tho some have strove to wrong him with his Friends;</l>
            <l>And Poets have so very few of those,</l>
            <l>They'd need take care whose favour 'tis they lose:</l>
            <l>Who'd be a Poet? Parents all beware,</l>
            <l>Cherish and Educate your Sons with care;</l>
            <l>Breed 'em to wholsome Law, or give 'em Trades,</l>

            <l>How many very hopeful rising Citts</l>
            <l>Have we of late known spoil'd by turning Wits?</l>
            <l>Poets by Critiques are worse treated here,</l>

            <l>Give him Bear-Garden Law, that's fair play for't,</l>
            <l>And he's content for one, to make you sport.</l>

                  <p>I had appointed to meet at <hi>Chatolins,</hi> but—</p>

                  <speaker>Goodv.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valentine,</hi> Thou art too much with that fellow.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed he is some relation to me, but 'tis such a lying Varlet, there is no induring of him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                  <p>But Rogues and Fools are so very plenty 'tis hard always to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape 'em.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trum.</speaker>
                  <p>Besides he dares be no more a Friend then a Foe, he never spoke well of any man behind his back, nor ill before his face: he is a general Disperser of nauseous Scandall tho' it be of his own Mother or Sister, prithee let's avoid him if we can to day.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Goovd.</speaker>
                  <p>'Twill be almost impossible, for he is as impudent as he is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som; as there is no Company so ill but hee'l keep, so there is none so good but hee'l pretend to. If he has ever seen you once, hee'l be sure of you: And if he knows where you are, he's no more to be kept out of your Room, then you can keep him out of your Debt.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                  <p>He came where I was last Night roaring drunk: swore Dam him, he had bin with my Lord such a one, and had swallow'd three quarts of Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne for his share, said he had much ado to get away, but came then particularly to drink a Bottle with me: I was forc't to promise him I would meet him to day, to get rid of him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Goodv.</speaker>
                  <p>Faith Gentlemen, let us all go dine at my house: I have snubb'd him of late, and he'l hardly venture that way so soon again: At Night I'le promise you good Company, my Wife (for I allow her for my own sake what freedom she pleases) has sent for the Fiddles to come.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Goodvile,</hi> If there be any such thing as ease in Matrimony, thou hast it: But methinks, there's as it were a Mark upon married men that makes 'em as distinguishable from one of us as your Jews are from the rest of Mankind.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Goodv.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh there are pleasures you dream not of: he is onely confin'd by it that will be so: A man may make his Condition as easie as he pleases.—Mine is such a fond wanton Ape, I never come home, but she entertains me with fresh kindness: and <hi>Jack</hi> when I have been hunting for Game with you, and miss'd of an Opportunity, stops a Gap well enough.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trum.</speaker>
                  <p>There's no Condition so wretched but has its reserve: Your Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel turn'd out of doors goes contentedly to his Kennel. Your Begger when he can get no better lodging, knows his old warm Bush; and your married Whore-master that misses of his Wench, goes honestly home, and there's Madam Wife.—But <hi>Goodvile,</hi> who are to be the Company at Night?</p>

                  <p>In the first place, my Cousin <hi>Victoria</hi> your Idol, <hi>Jack Truman;</hi> then Mr. <hi>Valentine,</hi> there will be the charming <hi>Camilla,</hi> and another that never fails upon such an occasion, the unimitable Lady <hi>Squeamish.</hi>

                  <speaker>Trum.</speaker>
                  <p>That indeed is a worthy person, a great Critick forsooth; one that censures Plays, and takes it very ill she has none dedicated to her yet, a constant frequenter of all Masquerades and publick Meetings, a perfect Coquet, very affected, and something old.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                  <p>Discourses readily of all the Love Intrigues of the Court and Town, a strange Admirer of Accomplishments and good breeding as she calls it; a restless Dancer: one that by her good will would never be out of motion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trum.</speaker>
                  <p>How <hi>Valentine!</hi> you were once a great Admirer there, have a care, how you speak too harshly of your Mistress, though the business be over. You stand well with the Ladies yet, and are held a man of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Goodv.</speaker>
                  <p>That indeed is a fine Creature. Your old harrass'd Stager has always some such resty Whore-master or another, whom she makes the best of her despair withall, and after being forsaken by half the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, comforts her self in her man of principles. But now I think on't, we delay too long. I'le go before and prepare: Gentlemen you'l be sure to follow?</p>

                  <speaker>Mal.</speaker>
                  <p>Why I was advising him to look after things better at home. The Fellow has married a young Wife, and there he lets her make Balls and give Entertainments. I was very free with him and told him of it to the purpose: for saith I should be sorry to see any ill come on't, very sorry.</p>

                  <p>But hark ye <hi>Malagene, Goodvile</hi>'s a sort of a surly Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and apt to have so good an Opinion of himself, that he is able to manage Affairs without your advice: He might have been very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere with you upon this occasion.</p>

                  <p>O Lord Sir! I beg your pardon, you are a new acquaintance there, I remember, and may design an Interest. Faith <hi>Ned,</hi> if thou dost, I'le ne'r be thy hindrance, for all she's my Kinswoman.</p>

I can't abide you should go abroad so soon, that I can't: You are never well but when you are with that wicked lewd <hi>Truman,</hi> and his debaucht Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion young <hi>Valentine:</hi> But that I know you are a good Dear, I should be apt to be jealous of you, that I should, ha, ha.</p>

                  <p>I, shaw! your Servant: Sure we that know one another may be free: You may say as much of me if you please. But no matter for that, did you hear nothing of my Business last Night?—hah?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trum.</speaker>
                  <p>Not a word I assure you, Sir. Pray how was it? Prithee let him alone a little, <hi>Valentine.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Malag.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, coming out of <hi>Chatolins</hi> last Night, (where it had cost me a Guinney-Club, with a Right Honourable or two of this Kingdom, which shall be nameless) just as I was getting into a Coach, who should come by but a Blustering Fellow with a woman in his hand, and swore, Dam him, the Coach was for him: we had some words, and he drew; with that I put by his pass, clos'd with him, and threw up his Heels, took away <hi>Toledo,</hi> gave him 2 or 3 good Cuts over the Face, seiz'd upon <hi>Damozel,</hi> carried her away with me to my Chamber, manag'd her all Night, and just now sent her off.—Faith, amongst friends she was a person of quality, I'le tell you that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Trum.</speaker>
                  <p>What! a person of quality at that time o'th' Night, and on foot too?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Malag.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, and one that you both know very well, but take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice on't.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Val.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, Sir, you may be sure we shall be very cautious of spreading any Secrets of yours of this nature.—Lying Rakehel, the highest he ever arriv'd at was a Bawd, and she too banisht him at last, because he boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of her Favours.</p>

                  <p>And you may take him if you will; he is as much a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as one would wish: I have not seen him this Fortnight; he never comes home till Four in the Morning, and then he sneaks to his separate Bed, where he lies till Afternoon, then rises and out again upon his Parole: flesh and bloud can't endure it.</p>

                  <p>Oh, if I would ever consent to wrong my Husband (which Heav'n forbid, <hi>Lettice!</hi>) it should be, to choose, with his Friend. For such a one has a double Obligation to secrecy, as well for his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as mine.

                  <p>Yes, Madam, at the Play-house in a Vizor, when you come drest and prepar'd for the Encounter; there indeed we can be as unanimously Modish and Impertinent as the pertest Coxcombs of 'em all, till like them too, we lose our hearts, and never know what becomes of 'em.</p>

                  <p>Why walking along, a lame Fellow follow'd me, and askt my Charity, (which by the way was a pretty proposition to me:) being in one of my witty merry fits, I askt him how long he had been in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?

                  <p>Good charitable Creature! But Madam, know I can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on you for this; and my revenge shall be to love you still; gloat on and loll after you where ere I see you; in all publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings haunt and vex you; write lamentable Sonnets on you, and so plain,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:199273:20"/> that every Fop that sings 'em shall know 'tis you I mean.</p>

                  <speaker>Cam.</speaker>
                  <p>So Sir, this is something: Could not you as well have told me you had been very ill-natur'd at first? you did not know how far it might have wrought upon me; besides, 'tis a thousand times better then vowing and bowing, and making a deal of love and noise, and all to as little purpose as any thing you say else.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Goodv.</speaker>
                  <p>Right exquisite Tyrant! I'le set a watch and guard so strict upon you, you shall not entertain a well-drest Fool in private, but I'le know it; Then in a lewd Lampoon publish it to the Town; till you shall repent and curse the hour you ever saw me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cam.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah would I could, ill-natur'd cruel man!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Goodv.</speaker>
                  <p>Hah, how's that? am I then mistaken? and have I wrong'd you all this while? I ask ten thousand pardons; curst damn'd sot that I was! I have ruin'd my self now for ever.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cam.</speaker>
                  <p>Well Sir, should I now forgive you all, could you consent to wrong your Lady so far? you have not yet been married a full year: How must I then suspect your love to me, that can so soon forget your faith to her?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Goodv.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh Madam, what do you do? the name of a Wife to a man in love is worse then cold water in a Feaver: 'Tis enough to strike the Distemper to my heart and kill me quite, my Lady quoth a!</p>

                  <p>I grant it, he is so; A Friend is a thing I love to eat and drink and laugh withall: Nay more, I would on a good occasion lose my life for my Friend; but not my pleasure. Say where and when it shall be?</p>

                  <p>Though I can hardly descend to satisfy your distrust, for which I hardly value you and almost hate you; yet to torment you farther, know I did discourse with him, and of love too; nay more, granted him an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, but one I never meant to keep, and promised it onely to get rid of him. This is more then I am oblig'd to tell you, but that I wanted such an opportunity as this to check your pretences, which I found grew too unruly to be kept at a distance.</p>

                  <p>Tho' I had some reason to be in doubt, yet this true resentment and just proceeding has convinc'd me: For <hi>Goodvile</hi> is a man I have little reason to trust, as will appear hereafter, and 'twas my knowledge of his baseness made me run into so mean a distrust of you: But forgive me this, and when I fail again discard me for ever.</p>

                  <p>Yes: But the next time I shall happen to discourse with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in private, I shall have you listning at the door or eves-dropping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the window.

                  <p>There is not such another Hypocrite in the World: He never made Love but to delude, nor Friendship but for his ends: — Even his own Kinswoman, and charge <hi>Victoria</hi> he has long since corrupted, and now would put her on his best Friend <hi>Truman</hi> for a Wife.</p>

                  <p>Now would this News be more welcom to her Ladishp Madam <hi>Squeamish,</hi> then a new Fashion, a new Dance, or a new Song: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Visits would she make on the occasion! not a Family in Town would be at rest for her, till she had made it a Jest. From the Mother of the Maids, to the Atturney's Wife in <hi>Holborn.</hi>

                  <p>But for some private reasons I would have kept it from her, and from Madam <hi>Goodvile</hi> too. There are Affairs to be carry'd on to Night, which the least Accident may interrupt.—Besides, I have thought upon't, and will so contrive the matter, that <hi>Goodvile</hi> shall keep his Assignation, and her Ladiship her self supply the place of the much expected charming <hi>Camilla.</hi>

                  <p>Good Conscionable Creature have patience, and don't you think of paying Debts too fast, there's an Account yet between you and I which must be made even; and I think I had best secure it now I have you in my custody.</p>

                  <p>An Assignation! an Assignation to Night in the lower Garden. —By strong good fortune I over-heard it all just now—but to think on the pleasant consequence that will happen, drives me into an excess of joy beyond all sufferance.</p>

                  <speaker>Victo.</speaker>
                  <p>But why should your Ladiship run into the mouth of danger? Who knows what scurvy lurking Devil may stand in readiness and seize your Vertue before you are aware of him?</p>

                  <p>Too violent!

But why should I spend my Time in talking of what but vexes me, when pleasures are so near me? Come my <hi>Victoria</hi> take me to thy arms, a moments Joy with Thee, would sweeten Years of Cares.

                  <p>Then Sir prepare your self, Mr. <hi>Goodvil</hi> is really jealous and mistrusts all or more then has past between us. His Journey out of Town was but a pretence, but we shall see him instantly in expectation to catch us together.</p>

                  <p>To secure <hi>Malagene.</hi> That ill-natur'd Villain has betray'd us, and is appointed by <hi>Goodvil</hi> chief Instrument in the Discovery: He has Cowardize enough to sell his Soul to buy off a Beating: He never told truth enough to be believ'd once so long as he lives. Get him but in your power, and he shall own more Villanies then ever were in his Thoughts to commit, or the necessity of our affair can invent to put upon him.</p>

            </head>
            <l>WELL Sirs, if now my Spouse and I shoud part,</l>
            <l>To which kind Critique shall I give my heart?</l>
            <l>Stay, let me look, not one in all the place</l>
            <l>But has a scurvey froward damming Face.</l>
            <l>Have you resolv'd then on the Poets fall?</l>
            <l>Go ye're ill-natur'd, ugly Devils all.</l>
            <l>The Marry'd Sparks I know this Play will curse</l>
            <l>For the Wifes sake, but some of 'em have worse.</l>
            <l>Poets themselves their own ill luck have wrought,</l>
            <l>You ne're had learnt, had not their quarrels taught.</l>
            <l>But as in the disturbance of a State,</l>
            <l>Each factious Maggot thinks of growing great:</l>
            <l>So when the Poets first had jarring fits,</l>
            <l>You all set up for Critiques, and for Wits:</l>
            <l>Then straight there came, which cost you Mothers pains,</l>
            <l>Songs and Lampoons in Litters from your brains:</l>
            <l>Libels like spurious Brats run up and down,</l>
            <l>Which their dull Parents were asham'd to own;</l>
            <l>But vented 'em in others names, like Whores</l>
            <l>That lay their Bastards down at honest Doors.</l>
            <l>For shame leave off this higling way of Wit,</l>
            <l>Railing abroad, and roaring in the Pit.</l>
            <l>Let Poets live in peace, in quiet write,</l>
            <l>Else may they all to punish you unite;</l>
            <l>Join in one Force, to study to abuse ye,</l>
            <l>And teach your Wives and Misses how to use you,</l>
